response to PD-1 immunotherapy in endometrial carcinoma"

-Raw and processed scRNA-seq/scTCR-seq data generated in this study are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE212217).<br />
-Raw bulk TCR-seq data of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were generated by an external core facility (Adaptive Biotechnologies) and are unavailable, but the processed data are available in Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.6985601) and GEO (GSE212217).<br />
-Raw exome sequencing data are unavailable due to the provisions of the trial sponsors; the processed exome variant calls are available in Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.6985601) and in this repository. <br />
-Copy number segmentation files are in this repository.<br />
-The predicted pathogenic/deleterious variant calls are available in the supplementary tables and also in this repository.<br />
-Various intermediate files and results from the study are also in this repository.
